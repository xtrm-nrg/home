    your post you place the '!' at the beginning of the second row and therefore it
    doesn't work as expected."

<p>So I recently resurrected a fitnesse project for a .Net project. I updated from 20101015 to 20110104. I also updated to the 1.9 release of FitSharp. I found that suddenly my old fixtures were unable to find the classes/types ("Could not find class"). After much investigation and digging around I discovered the following...</p>
<p>It appears as though namespaces that begin with a Upper case letter don't work with the import command. Even if you prepend the line with a !.</p>
<p>So</p>
<p>|import|<br />
|UpperCaseNameSpace|</p>
<p>|SomeClass|<br />
|someMethod?|<br />
|true|</p>
<p>fails to find the SomeClass type upon execution</p>
<p>|import|<br />
!|UpperCaseNameSpace|</p>
<p>|SomeClass|<br />
|someMethod?|<br />
|true|</p>
<p>also fails to find the SomeClass type</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>!|UpperCaseNameSpace.SomeClass|<br />
|someMethod?|<br />
|true|</p>
<p>works.</p>
<p>As does making the namespace start with a lowercase letter...</p>
<p>|import|<br />
|upperCaseNameSpace|</p>
<p>|SomeClass|<br />
|someMethod?|<br />
|true|</p>
<p>It really seems like import should handle upper case namespaces and/or prefacing the line with a !. Without digging further I am not sure if this falls on the slim side of things or if it's just the interaction with wiki syntax or some combination thereof.&nbsp; Anyway props to Owen over here at http://www.oweng.net/Visual-Studio-2010/Coded-UI-Fitnesse/integrating-coded-ui-and-fitnesse-fitsharp-slim-2.aspx who's post got me close enough to the problem to take the last couple steps and to this blog http://www.asoftwarecraft.com/2010/01/troubleshooting-with-fitsharp-and.html that showed the way to see behind the curtain. Here's hoping this helps others.</p>
