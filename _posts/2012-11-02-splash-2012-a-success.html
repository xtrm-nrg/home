<p>Chairing a track was a little work, a little fun, and totally worth the effort. While the industry side of the conference may not be as large as it once was we still were a positive presence at SPLASH (formerly OOPSLA). I hope we can make next years Wavefront &amp; Wavefront Experience bigger and even better. So if you have a system, method, process, etc to share or have a project experience that you would like to share keep an eye on the SPLASH 2013 website and watch for the CFP (Call For Papers). Also if you have a colleague/co-worker/friend who you think should present let us know. We are more than happy to help people through the process!</p>
