<div><span>After  working in the video game industry on four titles I learned what I did  not want to do for the rest of my career. In order to counteract the  chaotic development cycle, we typically worked 60-80hr weeks. </span></div>
<div><span>I  was lucky to find my next position at a company that had just begun to  embrace Extreme Programming. In the ten years since then I have sought  out Agile teams and promoted Agile methodologies. I have also learned a  lot about Agile and how and when to apply various techniques. Leveraging  my Agile experience has helped me mentor other developers and teams  ranging in size from 3 developers to 3 dozen or more. Currently I work  for the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research as a  solution architect, developer, and coach.</span></div>
